  \textbf{Ongoing research:} With the pervasive use of cameras, there arises an increasing number of video-based applications. Meanwhile, the derived data from the same video (e.g., bounding boxes) can be useful for multiple applications. We explore the intermediate results materialization and reuse opportunities across queries in a visual data management system (i.e., think MySQL for videos) called EVA.

  Due to the intensive network backhaul bandwidth requirements for a large-scale camera network, Edge computing is a better computational platform for smart camera systems.
  In this work, we study the necessary components for a smart camera system at the Edge and proper architecture (i.e., the mapping between the components and hardware resources).
  In particular, we use Space-Time Vehicle Tracking (STVT) as a concrete example, which aims to track \textit{all} vehicles \textit{all} the time.
  Collaborating with campus police, we deployed our system with live campus camera streams. \\

   To carter the needs of smart services for the IoT (Internet of Things) age, we propose DataFog, a geo-distributed data-management platform at the edge of the network, which provides low latency data access by its locality-based data placement strategy, and handles data skewness by short-term and long-term load balancing policy.

  SpaceFish provides a sandbox for all file operations at the user level. For the duration of a SpaceFish session, all operations related to files are executed on in-memory copies of the files, with the actual file system left intact.
